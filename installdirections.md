open up your fnf's files

open up assets -> data -> roses -> rosesDialogue

copy the dialogue from here

paste it directly over the pre-existing dialogue

dont break the syntax

save

make sure to keep the file name the same

also you might wanna make a backup of the original roses dialogue

spamming through all 28 lines gets annoying eventually
